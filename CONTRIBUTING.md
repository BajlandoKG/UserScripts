### Code Style
Many conventions are available for writing code, but in this repo there's only one correct and that's mine :)

Please use the following conventions:
* Tabs over spaces.
* I use 4 spaces with tab.
* Always append with an `;`.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
